**Steps to run the VIP**

1. Create an .f file (with the name socflist.f, because this name is being used in the makefile)
2. Add all your respective rtl and vip paths
3. After that, run "make all" in the terminal to get the VIP simulated and get the coverage report on IMC
4. Note that current makefile is supporting Cadence Xcelium, can be modified if using different tool.
